This is a work in progress 3BLD trainer. It is designed to be used with a smart cube to analyse solves and identify places to improve.
This is a more fully featured replacement for my previous trainer [BLD Tools](https://github.com/simonkellly/bld-tools).

## Planned features

- [ ] Standard timer functionality
- [ ] DNF Analysis
- [ ] In solve case timing
- [ ] Algsheet importing and generation
- [ ] Reconstruction export

Initially it will likely only fully support the GAN 356i Carry 2 as I have one which I can use to test with.

## Development

This project is built with the [Bun](https://bun.sh) javascript runtime.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run dev
```
